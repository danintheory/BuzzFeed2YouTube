# BuzzFeed2YouTube
Takes a BuzzFeed list and convert it to a YouTube video. For humor. 

For example 

[20 slightly incorrect names for food - BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/joannaborns/incorrect-food) 

becomes

[20 slightly incorrect names for food - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HXsTrNGHHg1)

which is much funnier.
